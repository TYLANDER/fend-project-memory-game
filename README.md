# Memory Game Project

Hi and welcome to this memory game.

Start the game by clicking a box to flip a card. This starts a timer.

You are graded on the amount of moves required to find all the matching pairs of icons.
A timer is also there to track your speed. You can restart at any time.

To run this project, simply ```git clone``` this repository, and open the index.html file in your browser window.

Dependencies:
Sweet Alert https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js
Jquery https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js

Thanks and have fun!
